Before running the tests you need to have an admin user who has generated token.
You can generate token as admin on the page: http://localhost:8111/profile.html?item=accessTokens
Token may look like that:

Do not remove neither admin user nor it's token.

If you have created token - replace whole content of this file with the token.
